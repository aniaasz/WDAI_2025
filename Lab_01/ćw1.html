<h1>Wondrous Winning Images From the 2025 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards</h1>
<h5>Marta Hill</h5>

    <p>
        The prestigious annual competition, developed and produced by the Natural History Museum in London,
        received a record 60,636 entries from 113 countries and territories this year.
        Photographs were judged anonymously by an international panel of experts who considered their originality,
        technical excellence and creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Highlighting the realities of nature—including habitat destruction and predation—has been central to the
        contest’s conservation mission. Since the competition began in 1965, it has rewarded images that reveal
        the awe-inspiring beauty of animals and those that bring to light threats to wildlife through photojournalism.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below, see a selection of the winning photographs, showcasing wildlife from many corners of the world.

        The photo, which won the amphibian and reptile behavior category, documents a breeding event that last just
        a few hours, triggered by heavy rains.

        A carnivorous pitcher plant glows with reflected ultraviolet light in Malaysia. This type of plant uses color,
        scent and nectar to lure its prey into the buckets, which contain digestive juices at the bottom.
