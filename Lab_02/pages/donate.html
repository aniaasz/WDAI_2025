            <h2>🐸 Help Us Keep Frogs Hoppy and Happy!</h2>
            <p>Frogs are much more than just cute, jumping creatures you hear croaking on summer nights.
                They are vital indicators of the health of our planet — when frog populations decline,
                it’s a clear sign that our environment is in trouble. These incredible amphibians help control insect
                populations, serve as food for other species, and even inspire scientific discoveries in medicine and
                materials research.
            </p>
            <p>
                But today, frogs around the world are facing serious threats. Pollution, climate change, habitat
                destruction, and deadly fungal diseases are wiping out entire species faster than scientists can study
                them. Without help, many of these unique creatures could disappear forever — taking a piece of our
                natural world with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s where you come in. 💚
                Your donation helps us protect frogs through education, habitat restoration, and awareness campaigns.
                Together, we can create safe spaces for frogs to live, breed, and thrive — ensuring that future
                generations will still hear their beautiful songs in the wild.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even a small donation can make a big splash! 💧
                Let’s keep frogs — and their funny little dances — around for generations to come.
